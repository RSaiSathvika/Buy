# Buy
Simple Product Website
This project consists of two basic HTML pages: a landing page showcasing two products and a thank you page for successful purchases.

Project Structure
index.html: This is the main landing page. It displays two sample products with a "Buy Now" button for each.

thank_you.html: This is the thank you page displayed after a successful "purchase" (simulated by clicking the "Buy Now" button).

Features
Product Display: Simple cards for two distinct products, including images, titles, descriptions, prices, and a "Buy Now" button.

Responsive Design: The pages are designed to be viewable on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS.

Thank You Message: A dedicated page to confirm a successful purchase.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web pages.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design. The CDN is used for simplicity.

Inline SVG: Used for the checkmark icon on the thank you page.

How to Run
Save the files:

Save the code for the landing page as index.html.

Save the code for the thank you page as thank_you.html.

Ensure both files are in the same directory.

Open in Browser: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by dragging it into your browser window.

Usage
From index.html, click on either "Buy Now" button. This will redirect you to thank_you.html.

On thank_you.html, click on "Continue Shopping" to go back to index.html.

Customization
Content: Modify the text, product images (by changing the src attribute of <img> tags), and prices in index.html.

Links: If you develop actual product detail pages, update the href attributes of the "Buy Now" buttons in index.html to point to your specific product pages. Ensure the href in thank_you.html points correctly back to your landing page.

Styling: You can further customize the look and feel by adding more Tailwind CSS classes or custom CSS in the <style> tags.
